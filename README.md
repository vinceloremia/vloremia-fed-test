## Target Front-end Developer Test

Hi, thank you for applying for the role of front-end developer with Target Australia!

We're really excited to learn about you, including your coding style, your problem solving, and your approach to development.

This test is not intended to take a long time. It is an opportunity for you to show us how you work, what you prioritise and that your skillset is aligned to work with us in our code base.

What we are looking for:

- How is your code laid out?
- How are you with styling components?
- How testable/tested is your code & how you follow code styling conventions

We don't expect everything to be solved entirely - time constraints are there and we know other commitments get in the way. When you are happy with your solution, please fill out any additional details in the ASSUMPTIONS.md - This file is there for you to lay out what you would do next, or any things you have purposely omited due to time constraints.

### The problem

Part 1: Create a small application that fetches data from the [RandomUser.me API](https://randomuser.me/api/), and displays the data in a small user card - showing only core data. Think of it as a card that would be displayed in a public web forum.

Part 2: Expand on the application by allowing it to fetch 5 random user cards, with a button to load a more cards. These cards should be stacked neatly like a conversation thread.

### Your solution

For your solution, we ask that you don't use a pre-existing CSS framework (Bootstrap, MaterialUI etc). We want to see how you go with styling components. We don't mind what solution you use for CSS (pure css, SASS, JSS, Styled Components etc) just that we can see how you style your components.

Feel free to use any state management tool as needed, and anything else needed to accomplish the goals.

### Submitting & building your solution

To build your solution, fork this repository and clone it into a local workspace. Work through any of your changes as you generally would, managing the commits through Git. When you are ready, and have updated your ASSUMPTIONS.md file - push your changes to your forked repository, and respond to the e-mail with a link to the repo. From there, we'll let you know once we've completed our assessment of your code, and you will be asked to delete your fork.
